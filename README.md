# Docker samples!

## Purpose
This is a collection of docker samples to quickly spin up various services running when you need to add a service to a docker compose file, or just run locally to do some development / testing.

I was tired of writing these from scratch everytime I needed to stand up an instance for testing or adding a section for an apps environment. This is just a quick reference for docker containers that people can use to quickly pull the sections for relevant images into a compose file or other container orchestration to speed development and testing.
